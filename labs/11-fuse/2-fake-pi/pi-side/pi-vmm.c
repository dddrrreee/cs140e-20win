/*
 * engler, cs140e: trivial "virtual machine" driver for the pi-side that
 * recieves messages from your laptop over the uart (you could change to 
 * use esp8266 or anything else) and acts on them.
 *
 * our use today: run a pi program on your laptop but ship the pi-specific
 * parts (turning pins on/off, rebooting) to the pi itself.  this is just 
 * a proof of concept.
 * 
 * note: difficult to do this without interrupts since the unix side can easily
 * overrun the pi's 8 byte fifo.   use ours if yours is flakey.
 *
 * don't worry: most of the file is comments!
