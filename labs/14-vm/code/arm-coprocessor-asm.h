 * If it is essential that the cache is clean, or clean and invalid, for
 * a particular operation, the sequence of instructions for cleaning,
 * or cleaning and invalidating, the cache for that operation must
 * handle the arrival of an interrupt at any time when interrupts are not
 * disabled. This is because interrupts can write to a previously clean
 * cache. For this reason, the Cache Dirty Status Register indicates
 * if the cache has been written to since the last clean of the cache
 * was started, see Cache Dirty Status Register on page 3-78. You can
 * interrogate the Cache Dirty Status Register to determine if the cache
 * is clean, and if this is done while interrupts are disabled, the
 * following operations can rely on having a clean cache.  The following
