## GPIO interrupt code.

Implement the various routines in `gpio-int.c`.

Will add a Unix checksum setup later tonight.

Should be able to run:
   1. `0-fake-test.c` these are fake tests: 0, 1, 2, 3.
   2. `1-int-test.c` you should be able to get an interrupt and figure out which
      way it goes (this is in the lab itself).
