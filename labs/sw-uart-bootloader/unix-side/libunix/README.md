Put all your unix utilities in here, one per file.

The `Makefile` will automatically gather them up and put them in
`libunix.a`.

We will eventually put this directory in `libpi/libunix` since the
routines will be generally useful for the rest of the quarter.  We leave
them here for the moment to make it less confusing to develop.
